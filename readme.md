# Revert Comment Field Position

Plugin to revert the "comment" field postion in the comment form output to what it was like pre-4.4 in WordPress.  This plugin positions the field just before the submit field.

This is kind of a dirty hack to get it to work.  I've opened a ticket on WP Trac to address this: https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/34731
